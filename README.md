# Rontgen
A Python package for the quantitative analysis of the interaction of energetic photons with matter (x-rays and gamma-rays). This package is named after one of the discoverers
of X-rays, [Wilhelm Röntgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Röntgen), who also
gave these energetic photons their name.
